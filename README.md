<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://studypod.tech)

Study Pod is a project made in the MetroHacks 2022 hackathon, an all-in-one study platform to boost productivity and
efficiency in coursework.

Webapp features:

* Ability to register and login, creating an account which stores everything
* Create to-do lists and write notes
* Each note can be summarized into shortform with all its key information using an NLP algorithm
* Built-in music player, helping you concentrate and relax while studying

In the future, other features will also be implemented, and we will try to maintain this project for as long as
possible.
